<p class="opener">THE MOVEMENT THAT USED SELF-EXPRESSION AS A WEAPON IN THE REBELLION AGAINST MODERN DESIGN. </p>

<p class="first">The Memphis movement originated in Milano Italy in 1980. The founder, Ettore Sottsass, created 
the Memphis group as a direct response to the minimalist and modernist movements, which were viewed 
as boring and stifling to artists who craved personal self-expression in design. The Memphis movement 
is well-known for the unique and colorful furniture that was designed, and it was one of the first movements
 with the intention of having form follow function. This concept was highly frowned upon in design and served 
 as a rebellion against overly simplified structures. The following pieces are furniture from the Memphis group 
 that was designed from the years 1980 to 1988.</p>

 <h2 id="start1">Carlton</h2>
    <p>By: Ettore Stottsass <br>
    Year: 1981<br>
    <br>
    This unconventional bookcase is brightly
    decorated with sleek, shiny laminate.
    The foundation is built from a sturdy
    wooden base that has been covered with
    a grey-speckled, Memphis-style pattern.
    The simple flat planes of color are
    juxtaposed by all the extra nooks and
    crannies. The Carlton is one of the
    Memphis group's most famous pieces
    due to its easily recognizable silhouette. </p>

    This console is covered in a pattern that
    is a staple of the Memphis style. It
    resembles a cracked black-and-white
    mosaic and adds zest to an already
    unusual design. Bright red knobs serve
    as accents that daringly create contrast.
    Without a doubt, if this piece was in
    anyone's living room it would surely act
    as an intriguing conversation starter. </p>

    This cabinet stands almost awkwardly
    tall with its abnormal leg length. The
    bold use of primary colors is a signature
    part of the Memphis style, which is
    clearly evident in this design. An
    extremely vivid red and yellow lacquer
    immediately catches the viewer's attention,
    and its lanky appearance gives you the
    feeling that the cabinet could start
    walking on its own at any second.</p>

    This sideboard sits in a solitary fashion,
    with its intense red overcoat balancing
    out the simplicity of the design. A
    single black knob creates a necessary
    dynamic that effectively adds character
    to the otherwise plain drawer. The
    knob's perfectly round structure and
    the odd proportions make the design
    appear cartoonish. The quirky, yet
    effortless essence of the Memphis
    movement is captured in this piece.</p>

            Year: 1987<br>
            <br>
    This sideboard resembles a maze and
    walks the fine line between simplicity
    and abstraction. The patterns on the
    base create a texture that implies a
    rough and uneven surface, employing 
    terrazzo tiles that are usually used on
    floors. Wood and plexiglass are also
    carefully placed throughout the design.
    Despite this sideboard having a diverse
    use of materials, the overall design is
    impressively cohesive. </p>

    This clock is one of the first Memphis
    designs that uses toned-down hues to
    create sophisticated pastels. Although
    the Memphis movement was known for
    bright colors, it was also known for retro
    colors which are neutralized versions of
    brighter tones that are seen throughout
    the other designs. Similar to most of the
    other designs, the structure of this clock
    is atypical and blocks of differing sizes
    construct a reverse-tier support system. </p>
